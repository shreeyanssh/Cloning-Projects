********Image Opening like curtains***************

1. How to alway keep a div centered a various widths:-
    .page2 img{
        height: 100%;
        width: 20%;
        object-fit: cover;
        position: relative;
        left: 50%;  /*this puts the start of the div at 50% of the page*/
        transform: translateX(-50%);  /*this move the div by 50% of its own width to center it.*/
    }

2. To get the effect write the code as following:-
    gsap.to(".page2 img",{
        width:"100%", //have to write in "" when using special char like %
        scrollTrigger:{
            trigger:".page2",
            scroller:"body",
            markers:"true",
            start:"top 0",
            end:"top -100%",
            scrub:"true", 
            pin:true  //Pins the trigger till the animation is completed
        }
    })

->Make sure the trigger is the element or the dive that you want pinned for 
the duration of the animation if you put the trigger on the 
image the image will not move and the you will not get the result.
->start is at the top and the end is when the page gets scrolled entirely
i.e. -100%(or 100% above the top) and the page is pinned till the 
animation ends thats how it works.
