********How To give font*********

If your given font is not working. Download the font family of that font form google and paste it in the same folder as the project and use this....

@font-face {
    font-family: work sans;
    src: url(Work_Sans/WorkSans-VariableFont_wght.ttf);
}


->font-family --->saves the name of the font(Name of your liking)
->src: url()--->Stores the loaction of the .ttf file.


********Manipulating img tag image**********

--->When we put a image as background image in a div we can use css properties like 
* backgound-size: cover;
  backgound-position: 20%(x-axis) 10%(y-axis);

--->In case of a img tag we cannot use above properties so we use:-
* object-fit: cover;


********Rotating A div***************
---> use rotate: 23deg;


#########--Problem Faced--##########
--->The two flex item left and rigth get merged into one another under the @media.

solution: instead of giving the height in percent or vw give it as ->fit content.
                                                        
--->When I gave position absoulute to the price div the align item and justify content properties stopped working and the size of the div shank.

I gave it width of my own but the divs were not centering on there own.
